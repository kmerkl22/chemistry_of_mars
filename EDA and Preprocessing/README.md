1. PreliminaryDataExploration.ipynb: The code in this file focuses on understanding the content of the folder provided by the organizers of the competition. It does not contain much of actual data analysis.

2. EDA.ipynb: In this file we obtain a more detailed understanding of our data by creating several plots and write a function that does a basic preprocessing of the data.
